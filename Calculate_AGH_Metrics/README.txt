This binary file may be run only when using one of the following options:
    ->  you have "cygwin1.dll" library added to your system PATH variable :
        
        set PATH=%PATH%;C:\cygwin64\bin

    -> you use the "Cygwin Terminal" to run it.

Both solutions work under the assumption that you have previously installed the "Cygwin" toolbox for Widnows
in C:\cygwin64 directory.
